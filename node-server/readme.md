example of building node server containers and passing them to different (ec2?) servers

the main goal was to have a server i can test locally, then easily throw at different servers with different environment variables.
This blends the local development and hosted deployment app (in different environments) easy to manage and run.

Next stage would be to incorporate turning into a custom image lambda function as well.
